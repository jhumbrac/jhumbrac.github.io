            <h3>What is Content?</h3>
            <p>In short this is your HTML, but more specifically web content is the textual, visual, or aural content that is encountered as part of the user experience on websites. It may include — among other things — text, images, sounds, videos, and animations.&ast;</p>

            <h3>What is Style?</h3>
            <p>Style refers to how HTML elements are displayed on your page. When we talk about style we'll often be referring to the code in your CSS.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="interact">
            <h2>How do they interact?</h2>
            <p>HTML provides the building blocks upon which your entire page will be structured. CSS is then used to manipulate &amp; shape the HTML. Your page design is the result of how your HTML elements interact with each other.</p>
            <p>Think of the HTML as the skeletal structure of the page. The CSS is the skin.&ast;</p>

        Common things I hear:
            Minimalism - minimalism does not mean minimul content. You still need as much content as it takes to convince someone to convert
            My info will be on other pages - if you don't give your users a reason to click on links they won't. That's not how we use the web in 2019
            I'll put in content later - Look at this page, it has over ____ lines of HTML, and almost every line is required to achieve this design. Without the html we have no css. This page could not be built without the HTML fully in place.
            <span>Most Importantly:</span> A website that makes no effort to achieve its conversions will only succeed at driving your potential customers &amp; clients into the arms of your competition!
        <p>If you cannot convince your users to hire you, read your blog, buy something from you, etc <span>They won't do it.</span> Period. Full Stop.</p>
        "This sounds like a lot of work"
        Not doing it this way will increase your workload by more than twice as much.

        <div>
            <h3>It's important to note that without HTML, your CSS cannot exist. Your HTML is just as important to the styling of your page as your CSS - maybe even more so.</h3>
            <p>Look at the page you're on. It has over ____ lines of HTML, &amp; almost every line is vital to achieve the design you see. Without the HTML we have nothing to attach the CSS to. This page could not be built without the HTML fully in place.</p>
            <p>It's for this reason that you need to finish your HTML before you begin styling your page!</p>
